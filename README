Description :
Program has structures which are t_signtool.
t_signtool has information about file pointers, file names, excutable section buffer and length.

After initiating t_signtool, program start to parse arguments.
In parser, it checks argument options and set file names.

After parsing, program open files.
After open files, program parse excutable section and save it to "char \*text" buffer.
Program throws error while opening and reading file, parsing, allocating has problems.

After read excutable section, program start to sign / verify files.

sign :
First, program make md by hashing excutable section to RSA-256.
And with the private key, program start to make signature.
After make signature, program make new binary file which has section .signature with signature.

verify :
First, program make md by hashing excutable section to RSA-256.
Then program parse section .signature.
And with the public key, program start to verify signature.
Program prints status of verify binary file to standard output.
